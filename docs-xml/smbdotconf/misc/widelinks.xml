	<para>This parameter controls whether or not the server may follow 
	(but not create or modify) symbolic links that point to locations
	outside the directory tree exported by the share definition.Â  It is
	more permissive than the default <smbconfoption name="follow symlinks"/> 
	option, which only allows symlinks to be created and followed within
	the share directory tree, and is not subject to the security risks
	of allowing a connected user to create and follow symlinks without
	restriction to any destination.
	</para>
	<para>Note: Since UNIX extensions allow unrestricted creation of 
	symbolic links, turning this parameter on when UNIX extensions are 
	enabled would allow UNIX clients to create symbolic links within 
	the share that could point to any files or directories elsewhere in 
	the UNIX filing system. Due to security implications, this parameter
	is therefore automatically disabled (with a message in the log file)
	if the <smbconfoption name="unix extensions"/> option is enabled. 
	</para>
	<para>
	See the parameter <smbconfoption name="allow insecure wide links"/>
	if you wish to disable the coupling between these two parameters, and 
	allow connected users to create and follow symbolic links to any location.
