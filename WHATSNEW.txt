Release Announcements
=====================

This is the first pre release of Samba 4.17.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Samba 4.17 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

Configure without the SMB1 Server
---------------------------------

It is now possible to configure Samba without support for
the SMB1 protocol in smbd. This can be selected at configure
time with either of the options:

--with-smb1-server
--without-smb1-server

By default (without either of these options set) Samba
is configured to include SMB1 support (i.e. --with-smb1-server
is the default). When Samba is configured without SMB1 support,
none of the SMB1 code is included inside smbd except the minimal
stub code needed to allow a client to connect as SMB1 and immediately
negotiate the selected protocol into SMB2 (as a Windows server also
allows).

None of the SMB1-only smb.conf parameters are removed when
configured without SMB1, but these parameters are ignored by
the smbd server. This allows deployment without having to change
an existing smb.conf file.

This option allows sites, OEMs and integrators to configure Samba
to remove the old and insecure SMB1 protocol from their products.

Note that the Samba client libraries still support SMB1 connections
even when Samba is configured as --without-smb1-server. This is
to ensure maximum compatibility with environments containing old
SMB1 servers.

Bronze bit and S4U support with MIT Kerberos 1.20
-------------------------------------------------

In 2020 Microsoft Security Response Team received another Kerberos-related
report. Eventually, that led to a security update of the CVE-2020-17049,
Kerberos KDC Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability, also known as a ‘Bronze
Bit’. With this vulnerability, a compromised service that is configured to use
Kerberos constrained delegation feature could tamper with a service ticket that
is not valid for delegation to force the KDC to accept it.

With the release of MIT Kerberos 1.20, Samba AD DC is able able to mitigate the
‘Bronze Bit’ attack. MIT Kerberos KDC's KDB (Kerberos Database Driver) API was
changed to allow passing more details between KDC and KDB components. When built
against MIT Kerberos, Samba AD DC supports MIT Kerberos 1.19 and 1.20 versions
but 'Bronze Bit' mitigation is provided only with MIT Kerberos 1.20.

In addition to fixing the ‘Bronze Bit’ issue, Samba AD DC now fully supports
S4U2Self and S4U2Proxy Kerberos extensions.

Resource Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) support
----------------------------------------------------

Samba AD DC built with MIT Kerberos 1.20 offers RBCD support now. With MIT
Kerberos 1.20 we have complete RBCD support passing Sambas S4U testsuite.
Note that samba-tool lacks support for setting this up yet!

To complete RBCD support and make it useful to Administrators we added the
Asserted Identity [1] SID into the PAC for constrained delegation. This is
available for Samba AD compiled with MIT Kerberos 1.20.

Customizable DNS listening port
-------------------------------

It is now possible to set a custom listening port for the builtin DNS service,
making easy to host another DNS on the same system that would bind to the
default port and forward the domain-specific queries to Samba using the custom
port. This is the opposite configuration of setting a forwarder in Samba.

It makes possible to use another DNS server as a front and forward to Samba.

Dynamic DNS updates may not be proxied by the front DNS server when forwarding
to Samba. Dynamic DNS update proxying depends on the features of the other DNS
server used as a front.

CTDB changes
------------

* When Samba is configured with both --with-cluster-support and
  --systemd-install-services then a systemd service file for CTDB will
  be installed.

* ctdbd_wrapper has been removed.  ctdbd is now started directly from
  a systemd service file or init script.

* The syntax for the ctdb.tunables configuration file has been
  relaxed.  However, trailing garbage after the value, including
  comments, is no longer permitted.  Please see ctdb-tunables(7) for
  more details.


REMOVED FEATURES
================

LanMan Authentication and password storage removed from the AD DC
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The storage and authentication with LanMan passwords has been entirely
removed from the Samba AD DC, even when "lanman auth = yes" is set.

smb.conf changes
================

  Parameter Name                          Description     Default
  --------------                          -----------     -------
  dns port                                New default     53
