Release Announcements
=====================

This is the first pre release of Samba 4.14.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Samba 4.14 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

Here is a copy of a clarification note added to the Samba code
in the file: VFS-License-clarification.txt.
--------------------------------------------------------------

A clarification of our GNU GPL License enforcement boundary within the Samba
Virtual File System (VFS) layer.

Samba is licensed under the GNU GPL. All code committed to the Samba
project or that creates a "modified version" or software "based on" Samba must
be either licensed under the GNU GPL or a compatible license.

Samba has several plug-in interfaces where external code may be called
from Samba GNU GPL licensed code. The most important of these is the
Samba VFS layer.

Samba VFS modules are intimately connected by header files and API
definitions to the part of the Samba code that provides file services,
and as such, code that implements a plug-in Samba VFS module must be
licensed under the GNU GPL or a compatible license.

However, Samba VFS modules may themselves call third-party external
libraries that are not part of the Samba project and are externally
developed and maintained.

As long as these third-party external libraries do not use any of the
Samba internal structure, APIs or interface definitions created by the
Samba project (to the extent that they would be considered subject to the GNU
GPL), then the Samba Team will not consider such third-party external
libraries called from Samba VFS modules as "based on" and/or creating a
"modified version" of the Samba code for the purposes of GNU GPL.
Accordingly, we do not require such libraries be licensed under the GNU GPL
or a GNU GPL compatible license.

Client Group Policy
-------------------
This release extends Samba to support Group Policy functionality for Winbind
clients. Active Directory Administrators can set policies that apply Sudoers
configuration, and cron jobs to run hourly, daily, weekly or monthly.

To enable the application of Group Policies on a client, set the global
smb.conf option 'apply group policies' to 'yes'. Policies are applied on an
interval of every 90 minutes, plus a random offset between 0 and 30 minutes.

Policies applied by Samba are 'non-tattooing', meaning that changes can be
reverted by executing the `samba-gpupdate --unapply` command. Policies can be
re-applied using the `samba-gpupdate --force` command.
To view what policies have been or will be applied to a system, use the
`samba-gpupdate --rsop` command.

Administration of Samba policy requires that a Samba ADMX template be uploaded
to the SYSVOL share. The samba-tool command `samba-tool gpo admxload` is
provided as a convenient method for adding this policy. Once uploaded, policies
can be modified in the Group Policy Management Editor under Computer
Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates.

CTDB CHANGES
============

* The NAT gateway and LVS features now uses the term "leader" to refer
  to the main node in a group through which traffic is routed and
  "follower" for other members of a group.  The command for
  determining the leader has changed to "ctdb natgw leader" (from
  "ctdb natgw master").  The configuration keyword for indicating that
  a node can not be the leader of a group has changed to
  "follower-only" (from "slave-only").  Identical changes were made
  for LVS.

* Remove "ctdb isnotrecmaster" command.  It isn't used by CTDB's
  scripts and can be checked by users with "ctdb pnn" and "ctdb
  recmaster".

Python 3.6 or later required
----------------------------

Samba's minimum runtime requirement for python was raised to Python
3.6 with samba 4.13.  Samba 4.14 raises this minimum version to Python
3.6 also to build Samba. It is no longer possible to build Samba
(even just the file server) with Python versions 2.6 and 2.7.

As Python 2.7 has been End Of Life upstream since April 2020, Samba
is dropping ALL Python 2.x support in this release.


NT4-like 'classic' Samba domain controllers
-------------------------------------------

Samba 4.13 deprecates Samba's original domain controller mode.

Sites using Samba as a Domain Controller should upgrade from the
NT4-like 'classic' Domain Controller to a Samba Active Directory DC
to ensure full operation with modern windows clients.

SMBv1 only protocol options deprecated
--------------------------------------

A number of smb.conf parameters for less-secure authentication methods
which are only possible over SMBv1 are deprecated in this release.

REMOVED FEATURES
================

The deprecated "ldap ssl ads" smb.conf option has been removed.
