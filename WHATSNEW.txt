Release Announcements
=====================

This is the first pre release of Samba 4.15.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Samba 4.15 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


UPGRADING
=========

Removed SMB (development) dialects
----------------------------------

The following SMB (development) dialects are no longer
supported: SMB2_22, SMB2_24 and SMB3_10. They are were
only supported by Windows technical preview builds.
They used to be useful in order to test against the
latest Windows versions, but it's no longer useful
to have them. If you have them explicitly specified
in your smb.conf or an the command line,
you need to replace them like this:
- SMB2_22 => SMB3_00
- SMB2_24 => SMB3_00
- SMB3_10 => SMB3_11
Note that it's typically not useful to specify
"client max protocol" or "server max protocol"
explicitly to a specific dialect, just leave
them unspecified or specify the value "default".

New GPG key
-----------

The GPG release key for Samba releases changed from:

pub   dsa1024/6F33915B6568B7EA 2007-02-04 [SC] [expires: 2021-02-05]

sub   elg2048/9C6ED163DA6DFB44 2007-02-04 [E] [expires: 2021-02-05]

to the following new key:

NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================
- bind DLZ: Added the ability to set allow/deny lists for zone
  transfer clients.
  Up to now, any client could use a DNS zone transfer request
  to the bind server, and get an answer from Samba.
  Now the default behaviour will be to deny those request.
  Two new options have been added to manage the list of
  authorized/denied clients for zone transfer requests.
  In order to be accepted, the request must be issued by a client
  that is in the allow list and NOT in the deny list.

"server multi channel support" no longer experimental
-----------------------------------------------------

This option is enabled by default starting with to 4.15 (on Linux and FreeBSD).
Due to dependencies on kernel APIs of Linux or FreeBSD, it's only possible
to use this feature on Linux and FreeBSD for now.

samba-tool available without the ad-dc
--------------------------------------

The samba-tool command is now available when samba is configured
--without-ad-dc. Not all features will work, and some ad-dc specific options
have been disabled. The samba-tool domain options, for example, are limited
when no ad-dc is present. Samba must still be built with ads in order to enable
samba-tool.

Improved command line user experience
-------------------------------------

Samba utilities did not consistently implement their command line interface. A
number of options were requiring to specify values in one tool and not in the
other, some options meant different in different tools.

These should be stories of the past now. A new command line parser has been
implemented with sanity checking. Also the command line interface has been
simplified and provides better control for encryption, singing and kerberos.

Also several command line options have a smb.conf variable to control the
default now.

All tools are logging to stderr by default. You can use --debug-stdout to
change the behavior.

### Common parser:

Options added:
--client-protection=off|sign|encrypt

Options renamed:
--kerberos       ->    --use-kerberos=required|desired|off
--krb5-ccache    ->    --use-krb5-ccache=CCACHE
--scope          ->    --netbios-scope=SCOPE
--use-ccache     ->    --use-winbind-ccache

Options removed:
-e|--encrypt
-C removed from --use-winbind-ccache
-i removed from --netbios-scope
-S|--signing


### Duplicates in command line utils

ldbadd/ldbsearch/ldbdel/ldbmodify/ldbrename:
-e is not available for --editor anymore
-s is not used for --configfile anymore

ndrdump:
-l is not available for --load-dso anymore

net:
-l is not available for --long anymore

sharesec:
-V is not available for --viewsddl anymore

smbcquotas:
--user        ->    --quota-user

nmbd:
--log-stdout  ->    --debug-stdout

smbd:
--log-stdout  ->    --debug-stdout

winbindd:
--log-stdout  ->    --debug-stdout

Scanning of trusted domains and enterpise principals
----------------------------------------------------

As an artifact from the NT4 times, we still scanned the list of trusted domains
on winbindd startup. This is wrong as we never can get a full picture in Active
Directory. It is time to change the default value to No. Also with this change
we always use enterprise principals for Kerberos so that the DC will be able
to redirect ticket requests to the right DC. This is e.g needed for one way
trusts. The options `winbind use krb5 enterprise principals` and
`winbind scan trusted domains` will be deprecated in one of the next releases.


REMOVED FEATURES
================

Tru64 ACL support has been removed from this release. The last
supported release of Tru64 UNIX was in 2012.

NIS support has been removed from this release. This is not
available in Linux distributions anymore.

which have been out of support since 2018.
