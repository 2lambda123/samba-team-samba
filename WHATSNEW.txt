Release Announcements
=====================

This is the first pre release of Samba 4.16.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Samba 4.16 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

Certificate Auto Enrollment
---------------------------

Certificate Auto Enrollment allows devices to enroll for certificates from
Active Directory Certificate Services. It is enabled by Group Policy.
To enable Certificate Auto Enrollment, Samba's group policy will need to be
enabled by setting the smb.conf option `apply group policies` to Yes. Samba
Certificate Auto Enrollment depends on certmonger, the cepces certmonger
plugin, and sscep. Samba uses sscep to download the CA root chain, then uses
certmonger paired with cepces to monitor the host certificate templates.
Certificates are installed in /var/lib/samba/certs and private keys are
installed in /var/lib/samba/private/certs.

Ability to add ports to dns forwarder addresses in internal DNS backend
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The internal DNS server of Samba forwards queries non-AD zones to one or more
configured forwarders. Up until now it has been assumed that these forwarders
listen on port 53. Starting with this version it is possible to configure the
port using host:port notation. See smb.conf for more details. Existing setups
are not affected, as the default port is 53.

REMOVED FEATURES
================

SMB1 CORE and LANMAN1 protocol wildcard copy, unlink and rename removed
=======================================================================

In preparation for the removal of the SMB1 server, the unused
SMB1 command SMB_COM_COPY (SMB1 command number 0x29) has been
removed from the Samba smbd server. In addition, the ability
to process file name wildcards in requests using the SMB1 commands
SMB_COM_COPY (SMB1 command number 0x2A), SMB_COM_RENAME (SMB1 command
number 0x7), SMB_COM_NT_RENAME (SMB1 command number 0xA5) and
SMB_COM_DELETE (SMB1 command number 0x6) have been removed.

This only affects clients using MS-DOS based versions of
SMB1, the last release of which was Windows 98. Users requiring
support for these features will need to use older versions
of Samba.

No longer using Linux mandatory locks for sharemodes
====================================================

smbd mapped sharemodes to Linux mandatory locks. This code in the Linux kernel
was broken for a long time, and is planned to be removed with Linux 5.15. This
Samba release removes the usage of mandatory locks for sharemodes and the
"kernel share modes" config parameter is changed to default to "no". The Samba
VFS interface is kept, so that file-system specific VFS modules can still use
private calls for enforcing sharemodes.


smb.conf changes
================

  Parameter Name                          Description     Default
  --------------                          -----------     -------
  kernel share modes                      New default     No
  dns forwarder                           Changed
