                   ==============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.13.0
                          September 22, 2020
                   ==============================


This is the first stable release of the Samba 4.13 release series.
Please read the release notes carefully before upgrading.


ZeroLogon
=========

Please avoid to set "server schannel = no" and "server schannel= auto" on all
Samba domain controllers due to the wellknown ZeroLogon issue.

For details please see
https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2020-1472.html.


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

Python 3.6 or later required
----------------------------

Samba's minimum runtime requirement for python was raised to Python
3.5 with samba 4.12.  Samba 4.13 raises this minimum version to Python
3.6 both to access new features and because this is the oldest version
we test with in our CI infrastructure.

This is also the last release where it will be possible to build Samba
(just the file server) with Python versions 2.6 and 2.7.

As Python 2.7 has been End Of Life upstream since April 2020, Samba
is dropping ALL Python 2.x support in the NEXT release.

Samba 4.14 to be released in March 2021 will require Python 3.6 or
later to build.

wide links functionality
------------------------

For this release, the code implementing the insecure "wide links = yes"
functionality has been moved out of the core smbd code and into a separate
VFS module, vfs_widelinks. Currently this vfs module is implicitly loaded
by smbd as the last but one module before vfs_default if "wide links = yes"
is enabled on the share (note, the existing restrictions on enabling wide
links around the SMB1 "unix extensions" and the "allow insecure wide links"
parameters are still in force). The implicit loading was done to allow
existing users of "wide links = yes" to keep this functionality without
having to make a change to existing working smb.conf files.

Please note that the Samba developers recommend changing any Samba
installations that currently use "wide links = yes" to use bind mounts
as soon as possible, as "wide links = yes" is an inherently insecure
configuration which we would like to remove from Samba. Moving the
feature into a VFS module allows this to be done in a cleaner way
in future.

A future release to be determined will remove this implicit linkage,
causing administrators who need this functionality to have to explicitly
add the vfs_widelinks module into the "vfs objects =" parameter lists.
The release notes will be updated to note this change when it occurs.

NT4-like 'classic' Samba domain controllers
-------------------------------------------

Samba 4.13 deprecates Samba's original domain controller mode.

Sites using Samba as a Domain Controller should upgrade from the
NT4-like 'classic' Domain Controller to a Samba Active Directory DC
to ensure full operation with modern windows clients.

SMBv1 only protocol options deprecated
--------------------------------------

A number of smb.conf parameters for less-secure authentication methods
which are only possible over SMBv1 are deprecated in this release.


REMOVED FEATURES
================

The deprecated "ldap ssl ads" smb.conf option has been removed.
