	 * There are 512 symbols, each encoded in 4 bits, which indicates
	 * their depth in the Huffman tree. The even numbers get the lower
	 * nibble of each byte, so that the byte hex values look backwards
	 * (i.e. 0xab encodes b then a). These are allocated Huffman codes in
	 * order of appearance, per depth.
	 *
	 * For example, if the first two bytes were:
	 *
	 * 0x23 0x53
	 *
	 * the first four codes have the lengths 3, 2, 3, 5.
	 * Let's call them A, B, C, D.
	 *
	 * Suppose there is no other codeword with length 1 (which is
	 * necessarily true in this example) or 2, but there might be others
	 * of length 3 or 4. Then we can say this about the codes:
	 *
	 *        _ --*--_
	 *      /          \
	 *     0           1
	 *    / \         / \
	 *   0   1       0   1
	 *  B    |\     / \  |\
	 *       0 1   0   1 0 1
	 *       A C   |\ /| | |\
	 *
	 * pos bits  code
	 * A    3    010
	 * B    2    00
	 * C    3    011
	 * D    5    1????
	 *
	 * B has the shortest code, so takes the leftmost branch, 00. That
	 * ends the branch -- nothing else can start with 00. There are no
	 * more 2s, so we look at the 3s, starting as far left as possible. So
	 * A takes 010 and C takes 011. That means everything else has to
	 * start with 1xx. We don't know how many codewords of length 3 or 4
	 * there are; if there are none, D would end up with 10000, the
	 * leftmost available code of length 5. If the compressor is any good,
	 * there should be no unused leaf nodes left dangling at the end.
	 *
	 * (this is "Canonical Huffman Coding").
	 *
	 *
	 * But what symbols do these codes actually stand for?
	 * --------------------------------------------------
	 *
	 * Good question. The first 256 codes stand for the corresponding
	 * literal bytes. The codes from 256 to 511 stand for LZ77 matches,
	 * which have a distance and a length, encoded in a strange way that
	 * isn't entirely the purview of this function.
	 *
	 * What does the value 0 mean?
	 * ---------------------------
	 *
	 * The code does not occur. For example, if the next byte in the
	 * example above was 0x07, that would give the byte 0x04 a 7-long
	 * code, and no code to the 0x05 byte, which means we there is no way
	 * we going to see a 5 in the decoded stream.
	 *
	 * Isn't LZ77 + Huffman what zip/gzip/zlib do?
	 * -------------------------------------------
	 *
	 * Yes, DEFLATE is LZ77 + Huffman, but the details are quite different.
